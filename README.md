# StyleGAN FaceSpace
This repository contains code utilising a PyTorch port of Nvidia's StyleGAN to construct a framework to generate blends of faces based on several face images, as well as experiments on style blending.

# PyTorch port of StyleGAN
Code for constructing the StyleGAN model is based on a PyTorch port of Nvidia's StyleGAN from the [Lernapparat repository](https://github.com/lernapparat/lernapparat/tree/541b6b1f21cbce602c4981cb3fb73f75b42227c8).
